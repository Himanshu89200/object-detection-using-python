**Object Detection Model**

**Overview**

This project implements an Object Detection model using Python to identify objects in images, videos, and real-time camera feeds. The model leverages deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or OpenCV with pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.

**Features**

Detects objects in images

Detects objects in video files

Real-time object detection using a webcam or external camera

Supports multiple object detection models

**Installation Prerequisites**

Ensure you have Python installed (recommended: Python 3.7 or later). Install the required dependencies:

pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow torch torchvision

**Usage**

1. Object Detection in Images

python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg

2. Object Detection in Videos

python detect.py --video path/to/video.mp4

3. Real-Time Object Detection Using Camera

python detect.py --camera 0  # Use 0 for the default webcam

**Implementation Details**

The model uses:

YOLOv5: For fast and accurate detection

OpenCV: For image and video processing

TensorFlow/PyTorch: For deep learning-based detection models

Example Output

The model draws bounding boxes around detected objects with confidence scores.

The processed images/videos are saved in the output/ folder.

Configuration

You can modify parameters like confidence threshold, input size, and output directory in config.py.

Future Enhancements

Add support for custom-trained models

Improve inference speed with model optimization

Support for multi-camera input
